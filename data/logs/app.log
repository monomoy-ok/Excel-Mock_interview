Clarity: The explanation is unclear and contains grammatical errors, making it difficult to understand. The term "private table" seems to be a misunderstanding of "pivot table."

Completeness: The answer misses important steps, such as choosing where to place the pivot table (new worksheet or existing worksheet), and how to add fields to the pivot table once created.

Feedback: The candidate demonstrates a basic understanding of pivot tables but needs to improve clarity and detail in their explanation. A more structured response would enhance their answer significantly.

Clarity: The explanation is unclear and somewhat disorganized. The candidate's reluctance to elaborate further detracts from the clarity of their response.

Completeness: Key points are missing, such as how to arrange fields, filter data, perform calculations, and the overall advantages of using pivot tables for data analysis.

Feedback: The candidate demonstrates a basic understanding of creating pivot tables but fails to convey the full potential and functionality of this powerful tool. More elaboration and structure are needed to provide a comprehensive answer.

Clarity: Without any content, there is no clarity to assess.

Completeness: The answer lacks any content, so it is completely incomplete.

Feedback: The candidate did not provide an answer, which makes it impossible to evaluate their understanding of the INDEX and MATCH functions. They need to provide a detailed explanation to demonstrate their knowledge.

However, the term "we look of age lookups" appears to be a typographical error.

Clarity: The explanation lacks clarity and coherence. The candidate's phrasing is somewhat disjointed, making it difficult to fully understand their process and the complexity of the problem they solved.

Completeness: The response is incomplete as it does not detail the specific problem they faced, the steps taken to solve it, or the impact of their work on the manager's decision-making. Additionally, it lacks examples of how the functions were applied.

Feedback: The candidate has a basic understanding of Excel functions, but the response needs more clarity and detail to effectively communicate the complexity of the problem they solved.

However, the mention of "if else" is not a specific Excel function and could be misleading.

Clarity: The explanation lacks structure and detail. The candidate does not clearly describe the complex problem they solved or how they applied these functions in a specific context. 

Completeness: The answer is missing critical details, such as the nature of the sales report, the specific challenges faced, and how the functions contributed to solving the problem. There is no mention of the impact of the report on decision-making.

Feedback: The candidate needs to provide a clearer and more structured explanation of their experience, including specific challenges and outcomes. More detail on how each function was used would enhance the response.

Clarity: The explanation lacks structure and coherence. It feels more like a list of functions rather than a narrative describing a specific project.

Completeness: The candidate does not provide details about the project itself, such as the context, objectives, challenges faced, or the impact of the work. This information is essential for a comprehensive answer.

However, it lacks specific details about the functions or features used.

Clarity: The explanation is somewhat unclear and contains grammatical errors, making it difficult to fully understand the candidate's experience and the complexity of the project.

Completeness: The answer is missing key points such as specific Excel functions (e.g., SUMIF, VLOOKUP, PivotTables), the types of visualizations created, and the overall impact of the project.

Feedback: The candidate should provide more specific details about the project, including the functions used and the outcomes achieved. A clearer explanation would enhance the response significantly.

Clarity: The explanation is quite unclear and lacks a coherent structure, making it difficult to follow the candidate's thought process.

Completeness: The candidate does not mention key components such as the syntax of the VLOOKUP function, the importance of the table array, or how to handle approximate matches.

Feedback: The candidate shows an attempt to explain VLOOKUP, but the response lacks clarity and accuracy. A more structured explanation with correct terminology would improve the answer significantly.

The use of INDEX/MATCH is correct, but the explanation lacks detail on how these functions were specifically applied.

Clarity: The response is somewhat vague and lacks a clear structure. It does not explain the specific problem faced or how the functions were used to address that problem.

Completeness: The answer is missing key details such as the nature of the data problem, specific examples of how VLOOKUP or INDEX/MATCH were applied, and the impact of the analysis on decision-making.

Feedback: The candidate demonstrates familiarity with advanced Excel functions but needs to provide more specific examples and clarity in their explanation. A more structured response would enhance their answer.

However, it lacks specific details about how these functions were applied.

Clarity: The explanation is somewhat unclear and lacks structure. It jumps from data gathering to cleaning and then to formula usage without a coherent flow.

Completeness: The response misses key details such as the specific challenges faced, the complexity of the dataset, and the outcomes of the project. It would benefit from examples of the formulas used and their impact on the analysis.

Feedback: The candidate provides a basic overview of their project but needs to articulate their process more clearly and provide specific examples to demonstrate their expertise.

Clarity: The explanation is quite vague and lacks detail. The candidate does not clearly describe the project or how they applied the functions, making it hard to understand their approach.

Completeness: The response misses key points such as the specific challenges faced, the steps taken to troubleshoot issues, and the overall impact of the project.

Feedback: The candidate needs to provide a clearer and more detailed account of their project, including specific challenges and solutions. Focus on articulating the technical aspects and the troubleshooting process more effectively.

Clarity: There is no clarity in the response because the candidate does not attempt to explain the concepts.

Completeness: The answer is completely lacking in content, missing all key points related to the question.

Feedback: The candidate did not provide any relevant information regarding the difference between relative and absolute cell references, which is a fundamental concept in Excel. A better response would include definitions and examples for each type of reference.

However, it incorrectly refers to "free lookup," which seems to be a misunderstanding of either VLOOKUP or HLOOKUP. 

Clarity: The explanation lacks clarity and is somewhat disjointed. The candidate does not clearly articulate how these tools are used to present insights or provide a coherent example.

Completeness: The answer is missing a specific example of a project where these tools were effectively utilized. Additionally, it does not mention other powerful visualization tools available in Excel, such as bar charts, line graphs, or conditional formatting.

Feedback: The candidate demonstrates some knowledge of Excel's data visualization tools but fails to provide a clear, complete, and accurate response. More specific examples and a better explanation of how these tools are used would improve the answer significantly.

It also incorrectly suggests typing the matching value directly into the cell.

Clarity: The explanation is somewhat unclear and lacks a structured approach. The candidate's wording is confusing and does not effectively communicate how to use the function.
